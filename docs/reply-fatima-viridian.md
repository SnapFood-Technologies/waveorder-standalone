**Hi Fatima,**

Thank you for reaching out and for sharing the details about your current setup with ChatDaddy. It's very clear to us what you're looking for — essentially a messaging automation module similar to what ChatDaddy offers, but built directly into WaveOrder.

**The short answer is: yes, we can build this for you.**

As the lead engineer on WaveOrder, I've already reviewed your requirements in detail and have outlined a clear plan for what we're calling **WaveOrder Flows** — a dedicated module within the WaveOrder admin panel that will cover the automations your business needs:

- Receiving and managing incoming WhatsApp messages directly from the admin
- Automated welcome messages with images and interactive buttons
- Away messages based on your business hours
- Custom flows triggered by keywords or button taps (e.g., "Order Now", "Location & Hours", "Menu")
- Conversation history and manual reply capability
- And more as the module matures

The goal is to match ChatDaddy's core functionality as closely as possible, so you can manage everything — your store, orders, and WhatsApp conversations — all from one place within WaveOrder.

**Regarding costs — let me be transparent.**

We are not trying to build a ChatDaddy competitor and then charge you $200–$300 per month for it. That's not our approach.

Here's what we propose:

1. **We will not charge you for building this module.** We're investing in it because we believe it adds real value to WaveOrder and to businesses like yours.

2. **We'd like you to be our first tester.** Once the first implementation is ready, we'll need your hands-on feedback to refine it and make sure it truly works for your day-to-day operations.

3. **What we need from you in the meantime** — while we build WaveOrder Flows in parallel — is for you to actively use WaveOrder under the **Pro plan**. If you could subscribe to Pro, that would be genuinely helpful for us. It supports the platform and gives you immediate access to all the existing Pro features for your business.

4. **If you're on the Pro plan, we won't charge you separately for the new module** the way ChatDaddy does. You'll get access to WaveOrder Flows as part of your WaveOrder experience.

So to summarize: you subscribe to Pro, use WaveOrder for your store operations, and we build the Flows module in parallel. Once it's ready, you test it, give us feedback, and you're covered — no extra charges like ChatDaddy.

We're genuinely excited about this. Your use case is exactly the kind of business WaveOrder was built for, and adding WhatsApp automation natively is a natural next step for the platform.

Let me know if you'd like to move forward, and if you have any questions at all.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

**Best regards,**
Bleron Acela
Lead Engineer, WaveOrder
