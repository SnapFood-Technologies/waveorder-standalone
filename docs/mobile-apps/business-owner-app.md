# WaveOrder Business Owner Mobile App

## What is a Business in WaveOrder?

A **Business** in WaveOrder is a complete store setup that includes:

- **Store Information**: Name, description, contact details, address
- **Product Catalog**: Menu items, products, categories, pricing
- **Order Management**: Customer orders, order history, status tracking
- **Customer Database**: Customer profiles, order history, preferences
- **Business Settings**: Hours, delivery zones, payment methods, branding
- **Team Members**: Staff accounts with different permission levels
- **Analytics**: Sales data, performance metrics, customer insights

Each business gets:
- A unique storefront URL (e.g., `waveorder.app/restaurant-name`)
- Their own admin dashboard
- Customizable branding and appearance
- Isolated data (only sees their own orders, products, customers)

## Why Single App is Better

### **Single App Approach**
- **One app in app stores** - Easier to maintain, update, and distribute
- **Business login** - Each business owner logs in with their account
- **Customizable branding** - App icon, colors, fonts, etc. change based on logged-in business
- **Shared codebase** - All businesses use the same app, just different data/branding

### **How Customization Would Work**
- **App Icon**: Dynamic icon based on business logo (iOS supports this, Android has limitations)
- **Colors/Theme**: App UI changes to match business branding
- **Business Name**: App title and content reflects the logged-in business
- **Data Isolation**: Each business only sees their own orders, products, customers

### **Alternative: Separate Apps**
You could build separate apps for each business, but this would be:
- **Maintenance nightmare** - Hundreds of apps to update
- **App store chaos** - Cluttered with similar apps
- **Development overhead** - Each business needs their own app build
- **Not scalable** - What happens when you have 1000+ businesses?

### **Recommendation**
Single customizable app is the standard approach for multi-tenant SaaS platforms. Think of apps like Shopify, Square, or any business management platform - they all use one app with business-specific customization.
