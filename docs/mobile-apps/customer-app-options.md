- **WhatsApp integration** - Orders go via WhatsApp

### **Customer Experience**
1. **Business shares link** - "Download our app: waveorder.app/restaurant-name"
2. **Customer downloads** - Gets the WaveOrder app
3. **App opens to that business** - No store browser, just that business
4. **Order normally** - Browse products, order via WhatsApp

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Deep linking** - App opens directly to specific business
- **No discovery** - Hide store browser/marketplace features
- **Business-specific** - App only shows that business's data
- **Custom branding** - App adapts to that business's colors/logo

### **Pros**
- **Focused experience** - Customers only see one business
- **No confusion** - No other businesses to distract
- **Business control** - Each business controls their customer experience
- **Simpler app** - Less complex than marketplace version

### **Cons**
