## Response 1: Product Image Slider Feature

**Subject:** Product Image Slider - Already Available!

Hi there,

Thank you for your feedback! I'm happy to let you know that the product image slider feature is already available in WaveOrder.

**How it works:**
- When you open a product modal (by clicking on any product), if the product has multiple images, you'll see:
  - Navigation arrows (left/right) to browse through images
  - Dot indicators at the bottom showing which image you're viewing
  - An image counter (e.g., "1 / 3") in the top-left corner

**To use it:**
1. Click on any product from your storefront
2. If the product has more than 1 image, the slider controls will automatically appear
3. Use the arrows or click the dots to navigate between images

The slider automatically detects when a product has multiple images and only shows the navigation controls in those cases. If a product has only 1 image, it displays normally without slider controls.

If you're not seeing the slider on products with multiple images, please let me know and I can help troubleshoot!

Best regards,
WaveOrder Support Team

## Response 2: Store Background Feature

**Subject:** Suggestion - Add a Custom Background to Your Store!

Hi there,

I wanted to suggest something that could help make your store even more appealing to customers!

**Consider adding a cover image/background to your storefront:**

This is a great way to personalize your store and make it more visually attractive. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your **Admin Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Business**
3. Scroll down to the **Cover Image** section
4. Click **"Choose Image"** and upload your desired background image
5. The image will upload automatically and save

**Tips for best results:**
- Recommended image size: 1920x1080px or larger
- File format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Keep file size reasonable for fast loading (under 2MB is ideal)
- Choose an image that represents your brand well - maybe your store interior, products, or a branded banner

The cover image will appear at the top of your public storefront header, creating a more professional and personalized experience for your customers. If you don't upload a cover image, the header will display a gradient using your primary brand color instead.

This simple addition can really help your store stand out and make a great first impression!

If you need help setting this up or have questions, feel free to ask!

Best regards,
WaveOrder Support Team
